# Sekar's Digital Blueprint

# Lovable Prompt — Dr. T. Sekar Portfolio Website

Copy everything below into Lovable's chat box to kick off the build.

---

Build a premium, professional academic portfolio website for a mechanical
engineering professor. This is not a generic template — it should feel like
a precision-engineered digital CV, blending an industrial/CAD aesthetic with
smooth, modern web animation.

## Visual Identity
- Theme: "Digital Engineering Blueprint" — dark graphite / steel-blue base
  (#0F1720, #1C2733) with a bright accent (#00B4D8 cyan or #FF7A00 safety
  orange — pick one as the primary CTA/accent color) and off-white text
  (#F4F6F8).
- Background texture: subtle blueprint grid lines, faint technical drawing
  linework, or a low-opacity engineering drawing/dimension-line pattern
  behind hero and section dividers.
- Typography: a clean geometric sans-serif for headings (e.g. Space Grotesk
  or Sora) paired with a highly readable body font (e.g. Inter). Use
  wide letter-spacing on section labels/eyebrows, like technical drawing
  callouts (e.g. "01 / EDUCATION").
- Iconography: line-art mechanical icons (gears, calipers, blueprints, CNC
  bits, molecule/composite structures) instead of generic flat icons.

## 3D & Animation Requirements
- Hero section: a subtly rotating 3D wireframe gear or turbine/rotor model
  (react-three-fiber / three.js) as a background centerpiece, slowly
  spinning, with parallax movement on mouse-move.
- Scroll-triggered reveal animations (fade + slight rise) on every section
  using Framer Motion.
- ALL interactive elements animate on hover:
  - Cards (education, publications, patents, memberships) lift slightly with
    a soft shadow and a thin glowing accent border on hover.
  - Buttons/links show a fill-sweep or underline-draw animation on hover.
  - Stat counters (see below) animate count-up when scrolled into view.
  - Publication list items shift right slightly and highlight on hover.
  - Nav links get an animated underline on hover.
  - The profile photo has a subtle 3D tilt-on-hover (perspective tilt
    following cursor) with a thin rotating dashed "measurement circle"
    ring around it, like a technical drawing annotation.
- Add 1–2 floating/rotating 3D or SVG mechanical elements (a small gear
  cluster, a bolt, a caliper icon) drifting gently in the background of
  secondary sections for depth — keep them subtle, not distracting.
- Smooth page-load intro animation (e.g. a brief "blueprint draw-in" line
  animation before content fades in).

## Technical Notes
- Fully responsive (mobile-first), with the 3D hero gracefully degrading to
  a static/lightweight animated SVG on smaller screens for performance.
- Keep animations smooth and GPU-friendly (transform/opacity based), avoid
  layout-shifting hover effects.
- Use a sticky/glassmorphism navbar that condenses on scroll.
- Include a dark-mode-first design (this theme is inherently dark); a
  light-mode toggle is optional/nice-to-have.
